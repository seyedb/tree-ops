Use trees and graphs to: 
* search for a given word in a text;
* solve a constrained binary quadratic optimization problem;

more to come ...

The following data structures are supported and tools to create, manipulate, or convert them into one another (if feasible) are implemented:
* arbitrary binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees<br />
* directed or undirected graphs and multigraphs

**Test Data**<br />
