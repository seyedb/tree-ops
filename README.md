Use trees and graphs to: 
* search for a given word in a text file: every paragraph of the text is stored in a (balanced) binary tree and the search is performed in those trees.

more to come ...

The following data structures are supported and tools to create, manipulate, or convert them into one another (if feasible) are implemented:
* arbitrary binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees<br />
* directed or undirected graphs and multigraphs

**Test Data**<br />
